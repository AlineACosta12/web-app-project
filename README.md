# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is currently not compatible with SWC. See [this issue](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/issues/428) for tracking the progress.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
# Web Application Project

## Description
This repository contains a group web application project and its full design/documentation pack. The goal is to complete the full software/web development process from start to finish: **idea → research → requirements → brief → sitemap/wireframes → build (DB + frontend + backend) → testing → deployment**.

## Team
- Aline Andrade Costa
- Sergio Alves da Silva

## Project Goals (to be finalised)
- Build a web application that solves a real user problem
- Deliver an MVP with clear core functionality (no scope creep)
- Produce a design and documentation pack (brief, sitemap, wireframes, testing evidence)

## Target Audience (to be finalised)
Define 1–2 main user groups and their needs (e.g., students, renters, local community, small business customers).

## Core Functionality (MVP) (to be finalised)
Example structure (replace with your final scope):
- User authentication (sign up / log in / log out)
- Create / view / update / delete records relevant to the app
- Search and filtering
- Responsive UI and accessible navigation

## Project Workflow (Checklist)
1. **Idea & problem definition**
2. **Research + requirements**
3. **Project brief** (summary, goals, audience, key message, competitor review)
4. **Scope + MVP definition**
5. **Sitemap + user journeys**
6. **Wireframes (and optional mockups)**
7. **Early feedback + iteration**
8. **Build**
   - Database design
   - Frontend pages/components
   - Backend logic/API + security
9. **Testing**
   - Links/forms/validation
   - Usability + navigation
   - Cross-browser + responsive checks
10. **Deploy**
   - Hosting + SSL
   - Live demo link

## Repository Structure (planned)
- `/docs/` — brief, research, competitor review, sitemap, wireframes, test evidence
- `/src/` — application source code (frontend + backend)
- `/assets/` — images, icons, media
- `/database/` — schema, migrations, seed data (if used)
- `README.md` — project overview and setup

## Installation / Setup (update once stack is chosen)
> Add exact steps once you decide your stack (e.g., PHP/MySQL, Node/Express, etc.)

Example placeholder:
1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies
3. Configure environment variables
4. Run database setup
5. Start the server
6. Open the app in the browser

## Usage (update once features are implemented)
Describe the main user flows:
- Create an account → log in
- Use the main features (create/search/update/delete)
- View results and manage data

## Testing
Testing evidence will be stored in `/docs/testing/` and will include:
- Form validation tests
- Link/navigation tests
- Responsive and browser checks
- User feedback notes 

## Project Status
Currently in planning / research stage.
