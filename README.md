## Project Overview

MoodPlay helps users decide what to watch based on how they feel. Instead of browsing endlessly, users can select a mood and receive movie recommendations through the TMDB API.

For this server-side iteration, the project focuses on:

- user management
- server-side CRUD functionality
- server-side validation
- session and cookie handling
- database integration
- online deployment

This backend is deployed online and connected to MongoDB Atlas.

### Protected Routes

Protected routes accept the JWT via either:

- `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header
- `token` httpOnly cookie set automatically by the server on login

---

## Database

The project uses **MongoDB Atlas** as the cloud-hosted database.

A seed script is included to generate demo data:

```bash
cd server
node seed.js
```

### Demo Accounts

- `demo@moodplay.com` / `Demo1234`
- `testuser@moodplay.com` / `Test1234`

---

## Testing

The MoodPlay backend API was tested using Bruno.

The following routes were tested successfully:

### Base routes

- GET /
- GET /api
- GET /api/health

### Authentication and protected access

- POST /api/auth/register
- POST /api/auth/login
- GET /api/auth/me
- GET /api/profile
- Unauthorized access test for protected routes

### Movie routes

- GET /api/movies/mood/:mood

### Watchlist CRUD

- POST /api/watchlist/:tmdbId
- GET /api/watchlist
- PUT /api/watchlist/:tmdbId
- DELETE /api/watchlist/:tmdbId

### Ratings CRUD

- POST /api/ratings/:tmdbId
- GET /api/ratings
- GET /api/ratings/:tmdbId
- PUT /api/ratings/:tmdbId
- DELETE /api/ratings/:tmdbId

Testing confirmed that protected routes worked correctly after login, records could be created, read, updated, and deleted successfully, and unauthorized access was blocked when authentication cookies were removed.

Testing included protected CRUD operations for watchlist and ratings after authentication.

The Bruno collection and saved request files are included in the project submission.

## Changes from Initial Plan

The original project idea included both frontend and backend features.

For this assignment iteration, the main focus was on implementing the **server-side components** required by the brief. The React frontend structure has been prepared, but the main completed work in this iteration is the backend API, authentication, database integration, validation, and deployment.

---

## Division of Labour

Work was divided across the team for this iteration as follows:

**Byron Gift Ochieng Makasembo**  
Backend architecture, database seeding, MongoDB Atlas setup, deployment to Render, and API implementation support.

**Aline Andrade Costa**  
Project coordination, deployment verification, backend testing with Bruno, database testing using `mongosh`, README and submission preparation, and frontend integration preparation.

**Sergio Alves da Silva**  
Backend code corrections, route and controller integration, project fixes, and support with implementation updates, and backend testing with postaman.

## File Authorship / Contribution Notes

The main backend files were developed collaboratively, with the following primary areas of contribution:

- **Byron:** deployment, database seeding, and backend structure
- **Sergio:** backend corrections, route integration, backend testing, and controller integration
- **Aline:** backend testing, deployment verification, submission preparation, and frontend integration preparation

---

## Project Status

**Backend:** Complete — all main server-side features implemented and tested.

**Frontend:** In progress — pages and components are being connected to the API.

**Deployment:** Live — `https://moodplay-myvq.onrender.com`  
**Database:** MongoDB Atlas
